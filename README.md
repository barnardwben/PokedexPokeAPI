# PokedexPokeAPI
 Pokedex from PokeAPI

This site was a built with OOP design in JavaScript using ES6 classes, prototype chaining, and inheritance, as well as being stylized with CSS. This was a follow along project, with my own additional design, where I gained a deeper understanding of how OOP can be used to keep code clean, structured, and prevent occurences of bugs. From this I was able to grow my skills in working with public APIs.
